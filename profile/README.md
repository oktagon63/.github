The main fight will be a clash of the generations, a battle between the old tough school and the predatory new school, and probably a big grappling concert.

“Bratislava is my turf”, said legendary fighter and former OKTAGON double champ, M-1 Global and Cage Warriors champion Ivan “Buki” Buchinger, who put on one of the greatest fights in the organization's history at the Ondrej Nepela Arena. Now one of the biggest talents in Europe, the 21-year-old “Namibian nightmare” Nafuka, dares to come to collect “Buki”s head, with the same brutal grappling skills Buchinger possesses. Will Nafuka finish the Slovak legend on his home turf and put an end to his career at the same time?

A fighter who always has his finger on the trigger in the cage - Ammari Diedrick - has the highly experienced “Prince of Bratislava” Pukač in his sights.

Pukač’s presence at the tournament means you can also expect to see the powerful iron fists of František Fodor, who beautifully outclassed Šikić in his most recent OKTAGON bout.

A clash between two warriors whose fights have become the stuff of legend, two former title challengers, and two of the biggest names in OKTAGON - Kertész vs. Apollo.

OKTAGON Challenge season 3 winner Karol Ryšavý is about to set off his explosive fists. He’ll be going up against Palokaj, who has already collected the scalp of Pokorný and remains the only fighter to defeat Islam Dulatov.

Smolková will be looking to claim another victory and defeat world #39, Brazilian warrior Mileide Simplicio.

Brno’s ravenous bad boy Roušal and his legendary brutal punches are about to go back in action! He’ll be put to the test by a big name in the tough Irish amateur MMA scene and champion of 3 different organizations, Jack Maguire.

A ferocious clash between OKTAGON Season 5 winner Paulus and unstoppable Finnish warrior Elonen-Kulmala, who’ll be returning to the OKTAGON cage for the first time in over two years.

Two-time title challenger Aby vs. one of OKTAGON’s most valuable assets, world flyweight #68 Zhumagulov

The greatest adrenaline-charged MMA show and everything that goes with it. On 9. 11. OKTAGON 63 at the Tipos Arena.
